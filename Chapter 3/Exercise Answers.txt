Chapter 3:
Exercise 1:
1. 	These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is 𝑦 in scope for 𝑧?

	Prelude> let x = 5
	Prelude> let y = 7
	Prelude> let z = x * y 		-- yes.

2.	These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is ℎ in scope for
	𝑔? Go with your gut here.

	Prelude> let f = 3
	Prelude> let g = 6 * f + h  -- no?

3.	This code sample is from a source file. Is everything we need
	to execute area in scope?

	area d = pi * (r * r)
	r = d / 2 					-- no. d is not defined yet, right?

4. 	This code is also from a source file. Now are 𝑟 and 𝑑 in scope
	for area?

	area d = pi * (r * r)
		where r = d / 2			-- yes, as where creates a local variable for the preceding function definition
