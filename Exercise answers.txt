Exercise 1:
1)  Given the following lines of code as they might appear in a
    source file, how would you change them to use them directly in
	the REPL?

	half x = x /2
	square x = x * x
    
    let half x = x /2 
    let square x = x * x

2)	 Write one function that can accept one argument and work for
  	 all the following expressions. Be sure to name the function.
  	 3.14 * (5 * 5)
  	 3.14 * (10 * 10)
  	 3.14 * (2 * 2)
  	 3.14 * (4 * 4)

  	 radius x = 3.14 * (x * x)

3)	 There is a value in Prelude called pi. Rewrite your function to
  	 use pi instead of 3.14.

   	radius x = pi * (x * x)

Excercise 2:
1)	Below are some pairs of functions that are alike except for parenthesization.
	Read them carefully and decide if the parentheses change
	the results of the function. Check your work in GHCi.
a)	8 + 7 * 9
b)	(8 + 7) * 9
	
	The brackets will change the output.

2)
a)	perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
b)	perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2

	The brackets won't change the output.

3)
a)	f x = x / 2 + 9
b)	f x = x / (2 + 9)

	The brackets will change the output. 
Excercise 3:
1) 	let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)
	
	Space between 3. and 14.
	let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)

2) 	let double x = b * 2
	
	Variable 'x' not used in function declaration, instead 'b' is used.
	let double x = x * 2

3) 	x = 7
	 y = 10
	f = x + y

	All declorations must be on the same column.
	x = 7
	y = 10
	f = x + y
