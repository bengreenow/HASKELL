Chapter 2 - Exercise 1:
1)  Given the following lines of code as they might appear in a
    source file, how would you change them to use them directly in
	the REPL?

	half x = x /2
	square x = x * x
    
    let half x = x /2 
    let square x = x * x

2)	 Write one function that can accept one argument and work for
  	 all the following expressions. Be sure to name the function.
  	 3.14 * (5 * 5)
  	 3.14 * (10 * 10)
  	 3.14 * (2 * 2)
  	 3.14 * (4 * 4)

  	 radius x = 3.14 * (x * x)

3)	 There is a value in Prelude called pi. Rewrite your function to
  	 use pi instead of 3.14.

   	radius x = pi * (x * x)

Exercise 2:
1)	Below are some pairs of functions that are alike except for parenthesization.
	Read them carefully and decide if the parentheses change
	the results of the function. Check your work in GHCi.
a)	8 + 7 * 9
b)	(8 + 7) * 9
	
	The brackets will change the output.

2)
a)	perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
b)	perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2

	The brackets won't change the output.

3)
a)	f x = x / 2 + 9
b)	f x = x / (2 + 9)

	The brackets will change the output. 
Exercise 3:
1) 	let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)
	
	Space between 3. and 14.
	let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)

2) 	let double x = b * 2
	
	Variable 'x' not used in function declaration, instead 'b' is used.
	let double x = x * 2

3) 	x = 7
	 y = 10
	f = x + y

	All declorations must be on the same column.
	x = 7
	y = 10
	f = x + y

Exercise 4:
	Now for some exercises. First, determine in your head what the
	following expressions will return, then validate in the REPL:

1.	 let x = 5 in x 				5
2.	 let x = 5 in x * x 			25
3.	 let x = 5; y = 6 in x * y 		30
4.	 let x = 3; y = 1000 in x + 3 	6

mint

	Rewrite with where clauses:
1. 	let x = 3; y = 1000 in x * 3 + y
	
	func1   = x * 3 + y
	where x = 3
		  y = 1000

2. 	let y = 10; x = 10 * 5 + y in x * 5

	func2   = x * 5
	where y = 10
		  x = 10 * 5 + y

3. 	let x = 7
	y = negate x
	z = y * 10
	in z / x + y

	func3 = z / x + y
	where x = 7
		  y = (negate x)
		  z = y * 10

Final exercise:

1. Make more explicit:

	1.	2 + 2 * 3 - 1
		2 + (2 * 3) - 1

	2. 	(^) 10 $ 1 + 1
		10 ^ (1 + 1)

	3. 	2 ^ 2 * 4 ^ 5 + 1
		((2 ^ 2) * (4 ^ 5)) + 1

2. 	Equivalent expressions
	Which of the following pairs of expressions will return the same
	result when evaluated? Try to reason them out by reading the code
	and then enter them into the REPL to check your work:

	1.	1 + 1  			-- Same result
		2

	2. 	10 ^ 2			-- Same result (100)
		10 + 9 * 10

	3. 	400 - 37		-- Not the same result as 400 - 37 != 37 - 400
		(-) 37 400

	4. 	100 `div` 3		-- Not the same result 100 `div` 3 would be 33 (or 34 idk) but 100/3 = 33.33333
		100 / 3

	5. 	2 * 5 + 18		-- Not the same as order of operations. 
		2 * (5 + 18)


3. 	Here is a bit of code as it might be entered into a source file.
	Look at this code and rewrite it such that it
	could be evaluated in the REPL (remember: you may need let when
	entering it directly into the REPL). Be sure to enter your code into
	the REPL to make sure it evaluates correctly:

	z = 7
	x = y ^ 2
	waxOn = x * 5
	y = z + 8

	let z = 7
	let y = z + 8
	let x = y ^ 2
	let waxOn = x * 5

1. 	Now you have a value called waxOn in your REPL. What do you
	think will happen if you enter: -- currently waxOn = 1125

	10 + waxOn  	-- 1135 will output
	-- or
	(+10) waxOn 	-- 1135 will output
	-- or
	(-) 15 waxOn 	-- -1110 will output
	-- or
	(-) waxOn 15	-- 1110 will output

2. 	Earlier we looked at a function called triple. While your REPL
	has waxOn in session, re-enter the triple function at the prompt:
	let triple x = x * 3

3. 	Now, what will happen if we enter this at our GHCi prompt?
	What do you think will happen first, considering what role waxOn
	is playing in this function call? Then enter it, see what does
	happen, and check your understanding:
	
	triple waxOn -- Will output waxOn * 3 

4. 	Rewrite waxOn as an expression with a where clause in your source
	file. Load it into your REPL and make sure it still works as
	expected.

	waxOn = x * 5 -- This code block didnt work for some reason, so after experimenting...
	where x = y ^ 2
		  y = z + 8
		  z = 7

	waxOn = x * 5 where z = 7; y = z + 8; x = y ^ 2 -- I came up with this
