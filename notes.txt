Notes:

Lambda:
	free variables are variables that dont appear in the head, and are generally left over if the function is used. 

	A combinator is a function in which every term appears in the head and the body. ie
	(lambda) x.x
	or
	(lambda) xym.xy -- despite m not bound to anything, this is still a combinator

	(lambda) xy.xyz is NOT a combinator

	combinators are used to combine functions together

	Divergence: the reduction process never ends.
	(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)

	([𝑥 ∶= (𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)]𝑥𝑥)

	(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)
